Gesture Recognition
This script detects a specific gesture within a video sequence. It compares a gesture representation (an image or a short video clip) with each frame of the test video. If the gesture is detected in a frame, the script overlays the word "DETECTED" in bright green on the top right corner of the frame.

Assumptions
The provided gesture representation accurately represents the gesture to be detected.
The test video contains gestures that may not be exactly similar to the gesture representation but share similar characteristics.
The test video is in a common video format compatible with OpenCV (e.g., MP4, AVI).
The gesture occurs within the test video with varying scale, orientation, and background.
Dependencies
The script requires the OpenCV library (cv2) for image and video processing. Install it using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Output
The final processed video will be saved as final_output.mp4.
Approach
1. Loading Gesture Representation
The script loads the gesture representation (image or video clip) using OpenCV.

2. Initializing Feature Detector
The script initializes the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) detector, a robust feature detection algorithm.

3. Feature Extraction
The script detects keypoints and computes descriptors for the gesture representation using SIFT. This step captures distinctive features of the gesture.

4. Reading Test Video
The script reads the test video sequence frame by frame using OpenCV's video capture functionality.

5. Feature Matching
For each frame of the test video, the script detects keypoints and computes descriptors. It then matches these descriptors with those of the gesture representation using the Brute-Force Matcher provided by OpenCV.

6. Filtering Matches
To ensure reliable matches, the script applies a ratio test to filter out low-quality matches and retain only high-quality matches.

7. Gesture Detection
If a sufficient number of good matches are found between the gesture representation and a frame of the test video, the script considers the gesture detected in that frame.

8. Overlaying Text
Upon detecting the gesture in a frame, the script overlays the text "DETECTED" in bright green on the top right corner of the frame using OpenCV's drawing functions.

9. Displaying Output
The processed frames with the overlaid text are displayed in a window using OpenCV.

10. Saving Output
Finally, the script writes the processed frames to an output video file.
