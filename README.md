Gesture-Based Volume Control
This script allows you to control the system volume using hand gestures detected through a webcam. The volume is adjusted based on the distance between the thumb and index finger tips.

Assumptions
A webcam is available and connected to your system.
The system volume can be controlled programmatically (Windows environment recommended).
Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:

OpenCV for capturing and processing video frames.
Mediapipe for hand gesture recognition.
Pycaw for controlling the system volume.
Install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe pycaw comtypes
Output: 
The script adjusts the system volume in real-time based on hand gestures detected via the webcam.

Approach
1. Initializing Mediapipe Hands
The script uses the Mediapipe library to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.

2. Initializing Pycaw for Volume Control
The script uses Pycaw to control the system volume.

3. Capturing Video Frames
The script captures video frames from the webcam using OpenCV.

4. Hand Gesture Detection
For each video frame, the script:

Detects hand landmarks using Mediapipe.
Calculates the distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip.
5. Volume Control
The script maps the distance between the thumb and index finger tips to the system volume range and adjusts the volume smoothly.

6. Displaying Video Frames
The script overlays hand landmarks on the video frames and displays them in a window using OpenCV.

7. Exiting the Program
The script runs until the 'q' key is pressed, at which point it releases the webcam and closes all windows.
